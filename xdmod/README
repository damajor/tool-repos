Open XDMoD (XD Metrics on Demand) is an NSF-funded open source tool derived from XDMoD which was originally designed to audit and facilitate the utilization of the XSEDE cyberinfrastructure. Open XDMoD has been created to be functional in any HPC environment and provides a wide range of metrics on HPC resources, including resource utilization, resource performance, and impact on scholarship and research. The Open XDMoD framework is designed to meet the following objectives: (1) provide the user community with a tool to manage their allocations and optimize their resource utilization, (2) provide operational staff with the ability to monitor and tune resource performance, (3) provide management with a tool to monitor utilization, user base, and performance of resources, and (4) provide metrics to help measure scientific impact.
