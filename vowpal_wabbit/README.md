This is a project started at Yahoo! Research and continuing at Microsoft Research to design a fast, scalable, useful learning algorithm.
VW is the essence of speed in machine learning, able to learn from terafeature datasets with ease. Via parallel learning, it can exceed the throughput of any single machine network interface when doing linear learning, a first amongst learning algorithms.
