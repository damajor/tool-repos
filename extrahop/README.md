Extrahop is a network-monitoring appliance (solution) that provides real-time insight into traffic flowing trough your systems.
It runs an agent on the monitored systems that aggregate the data then parsed in the collector(s) for analysis.
Provides dashboards, metrics and analysis. 
Collector works both as an hardware appliance and Amazon AMI and remains under the control of the organizatoin (not sharing data with EH)
It can be further extended via scripts/triggers for anomaly detecion and alerting purposes.
