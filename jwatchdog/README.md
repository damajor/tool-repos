jWatchdog
=========
The jWatchdog project delivers a simple watchdog to actively monitor your infrastructure and send you notifications in case something goes wrong.

jWatchdog is configured using a simple XML configuration file. This configuration file can be changed on-the-fly without a need to restart the watchdog.

jWatchdog also comes with an Android client application capable of intercepting and alerting on jWatchdog SMS messages.
