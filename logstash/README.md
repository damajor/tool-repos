logstash is a tool for managing events and logs. You can use it to collect logs,
parse them, and store them for later use (like, for searching). Speaking of
searching, logstash comes with a web interface for searching and drilling into
all of your logs.

It is fully free and fully open source. The license is Apache 2.0, meaning you
are pretty much free to use it however you want in whatever way.

If you are looking for a 'front-end' to search through logstash data, Kibana
is a good choice.
